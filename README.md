# Eat-da-burger

<!-- ![Employee-Tracker](./assets/employee-tracker.gif?raw=true "Employee Tracker") -->

## Description

This is just a fun app for a fictitious restaurant that enables the user to indicate what kind of burger they'd like to "Devour".

How it works:

The user arrives at a landing page with a blank text field to enter what kind of burger they'd like to eat. The user can enter just one burger meal option or several - the app will just continue to list the burgers on the left hand side of the web page. Then the user can click on the "Devour" button which transfers the burger that's listed on the left hand uneaten side, to its counterpart eaten list on the right hand side.

And that's it - pretty simple :)
